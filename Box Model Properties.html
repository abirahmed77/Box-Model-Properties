      Burger is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,
      typically beef—p laced inside a sliced bun or bread roll. A hamburger
      patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger. Under some definitions,
      and in some cultures, a burger is considered a sandwich. burgers are
      typically associated with fast-food restaurants and diners but are also
      sold at various other restaurants, including more expensive high-end
      establishments. There are many international and regional variations of
      burgers. Some of the largest multinational fast-food chains have a burger
      as one of their core products: McDonald's Big Mac and Burger King's
      Whopper have become global icons of American culture.

        Sandwich is a dish typically consisting of meat, cheese or vegetables 
        used as a filling between slices of bread, or placed on a slice of 
        bread, or more generally any dish in which bread serves as a container
        or wrapper for another food type. The sandwich began as a portable, 
        convenient finger food in the Western world, though over time it has 
        become prevalent worldwide. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture
        and the Food and Drug Administration are the responsible agencies for 
        protecting the definition of sandwich. The same USDA manual determines the 
        burritos and fajitas are sandwich-like, and frankfurters are sandwich 
        type, while stromboli is explicitly excluded.
